    "reasoning": "The paper focuses on catalytic IgM antibodies that degrade misfolded transthyretin amyloid, which is related to age-associated amyloidosis. However, the study centers on a specific immune mechanism targeting a particular misfolded protein rather than proposing or testing a general theory of aging. It does not discuss general causal mechanisms of aging or aging theories but rather a specific molecular immune function related to amyloid degradation.",

    "reasoning": "The paper focuses on psychosocial stress appraisal and its role in mental health disparities (anxiety and depressive symptoms) among older adults, specifically black-white differences. While it deals with aging and mental health, it does not propose, test, or discuss general causal theories of biological or psychosocial aging processes. Instead, it examines stress exposure and appraisal as factors influencing mental health outcomes, without framing these within a broader aging theory context.",

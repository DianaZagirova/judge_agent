Map the {num_papers} aging theories to standardized theory names from the provided list.

#CRITICAL: You MUST provide EXACTLY {num_papers} results in the EXACT same order as the numbered list below. Do not skip any entry.

#CONSERVATIVE MODE - STRICT RULES:
1. For EACH numbered theory (1 through {num_papers}), provide a result in the exact same order
2. Copy the EXACT theory text as "initial_theory_name" - do not rephrase or modify it
3. ONLY map if confidence is HIGH (7-10). If confidence is 6 or below, return null
4. You can map to multiple theories if the text clearly mentions multiple distinct concepts
5. DO NOT create NEW_ theories. If no good match exists (confidence ≤6), return null instead
6. ONLY use theory names that are in the "Available standardized names" list below
7. If theory text is nonsense/unintelligible, return null
8. MAINTAIN ORDER: Result position must match input position (entry 1 → result 1, entry 2 → result 2, etc.)

#Initial theories to map (process in order):     
{theories_input}

#Available standardized names (USE ONLY THESE):
{theories_list}

#Output Format (JSON only, no markdown):
#IMPORTANT: Return EXACTLY {num_papers} entries in the results array, in the same order as above.

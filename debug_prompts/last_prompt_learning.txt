Map the 7 aging theories to standardized theory names, or identify new theories.

#CRITICAL: You MUST provide EXACTLY 7 results in the EXACT same order as the numbered list below. Do not skip any entry.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For EACH numbered theory (1 through 7), provide a result in the exact same order
2. Copy the EXACT theory text as "initial_theory_name" - do not rephrase or modify it  
3. You can map to 1 or multiple theories if the text mentions multiple concepts
4. For each match, provide a confidence score (1-10): how certain you are
5. If theory text is complete nonsense/unintelligible, output null for it
6. If the theory doesn't match any standardized theory well (confidence < 6), prefix with "NEW_" and provide a clean theory name
7. For NEW_ theories, also provide 5-10 relevant keywords that describe this theory
8. MAINTAIN ORDER: Result position must match input position (entry 1 → result 1, entry 2 → result 2, etc.)

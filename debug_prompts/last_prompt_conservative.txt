Map the 1 aging theories to standardized theory names from the provided list.

#CRITICAL: You MUST provide EXACTLY 1 results in the EXACT same order as the numbered list below. Do not skip any entry.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For EACH numbered theory (1 through 1), provide a result in the exact same order
2. Copy the EXACT theory text as "initial_theory_name" - do not rephrase or modify it
3. ONLY map if confidence is HIGH (7-10). If confidence is 6 or below, return null
4. You can map to multiple theories if the text clearly mentions multiple distinct concepts
5. ONLY use theory names that are in the "Available standardized names" list below
6. If text is nonsense/unintelligible, return null
7. MAINTAIN ORDER: Result position must match input position (entry 1 → result 1, entry 2 → result 2, etc.)

# 🧬 Aging Theory Paper Filter: AI-Powered Scientific Literature Classification

> *Stage 3: Fast and efficient filtering system for aging-theory related papers from massive scientific literature collections*

## Stage 3 GOALS

This stage focuses on **rapidly identifying and filtering aging-theory-related papers** from a massive and noisy collection (over 108,000 papers collected on Stage 1 - 2). Its objective is to serve as a precise and computationally efficient filter before more detailed downstream analyses of aging theories.

- Provide a **fast, efficient, and low-cost system** to filter out papers unlikely to be relevant to aging theory.
- Optimize for **precision** (confidence in excluded papers), as earlier stages emphasized recall and accumulated many irrelevant articles.
- Leverage additinal LLM with thinking and prompt engineering for smart, automated classification.

## 🚀 Production Usage

### Running the Main Processing Pipeline

For processing large-scale paper collections (beyond the demo), use the enhanced production script:

```bash
python src/process_papers_enhanced.py [OPTIONS]
```

#### System Architecture

The production pipeline consists of two main components:

1. **`src/process_papers_enhanced.py`** - Main orchestration script
   - Manages parallel processing with worker pools
   - Handles database I/O and checkpointing
   - Provides progress monitoring and logging
   - Implements graceful shutdown and resume capability
   - **This is the script you run** for production processing

2. **`src/llm_judge.py`** - Core classification engine
   - Called automatically by `process_papers_enhanced.py` for each paper
   - Handles LLM API communication (OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Parses and validates LLM responses
   - Tracks token usage and costs
   - **Not meant to be run directly** - used as a module by the main script

### Prompt Engineering and LLM Judge Configuration

The classification logic is defined in **`prompts/system_prompt_judge.py`**, which contains the carefully engineered system prompt used by the LLM judge.

#### Prompt Structure

The prompt (`PROMPT` variable in `system_prompt_judge.py`) includes:

1. **Core Definition** - Precise definition of "Theory of Aging"
   - Focuses on general causal explanations for biological/psychosocial aging
   - Distinguishes between specific findings and generalizable theories

2. **Inclusion Criteria** - What makes a paper valid:
   - Papers proposing new general causal mechanisms (damage accumulation, entropy, epigenetic drift)
   - Reviews, syntheses, or comparisons of existing aging theories
   - Empirical tests of aging theory predictions
   - Mathematical/computational formalizations with general implications
   - Evolutionary reasoning about aging (antagonistic pleiotropy, disposable soma)
   - Historical or meta-theoretical analyses

3. **Exclusion Criteria** - What to filter out:
   - Disease-specific pathogenesis without generalization to aging
   - Narrow gene/pathway studies without broader aging connections
   - Biomarker/clock development focused solely on prediction
   - Clinical geriatrics, health services, demographics
   - Cosmetic aging, materials science, unrelated fields
   - Editorials without specific causal mechanisms

4. **Edge Case Handling** - Explicit guidance for ambiguous cases:
   - Hallmarks of aging reviews → Valid
   - Senolytics/senescence → Valid if testing causal role in aging
   - Epigenetic clocks → Valid if discussing causal mechanisms, not just prediction
   - Psychosocial theories → Valid if recognized theories (disengagement, continuity)
   - Mathematical models → Valid if formalizing causal mechanisms

5. **Step-by-Step Reasoning Framework** - 6-step analysis process:
   - Main topic identification (biological vs psychosocial aging)
   - Theory relevance assessment
   - Scope evaluation (narrow vs generalizable)
   - Exclusion criteria check
   - Non-trivial case analysis
   - Final classification with confidence scoring

6. **Structured Output Format** - JSON schema with required fields:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "research|review|discussion|other",
     "reasoning": "<short reasoning>",
     "result": "valid|doubted|not_valid",
     "confidence_score": 0-10,
     "aging_theory": "<specific theory name or null>"
   }
   ```

#### How the Prompt is Used

The `llm_judge.py` script:
1. Imports the `PROMPT` from `prompts/system_prompt_judge.py`
2. Sends it as the system message to the LLM
3. Provides the paper's title and abstract as the user message
4. Receives structured JSON response following the defined schema
5. Parses and validates the response before saving to database

This separation allows for easy prompt iteration and A/B testing without modifying the core processing logic.

#### Command-Line Parameters

- `--limit N`: Process only N papers (default: all unprocessed papers)
- `--workers N`: Number of parallel workers for concurrent processing (default: 10)
- `--test`: Test mode - processes only 5 papers with 2 workers for validation

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Process all unprocessed papers with 10 workers (production mode)
python src/process_papers_enhanced.py --workers 10

# Process 1000 papers with 5 workers
python src/process_papers_enhanced.py --limit 1000 --workers 5

# Test mode - validate setup with 5 papers
python src/process_papers_enhanced.py --test

# Process specific batch with custom worker count
python src/process_papers_enhanced.py --limit 5000 --workers 15
```

### How the Database is Updated

The processing pipeline automatically manages the SQLite database (`data/evaluations.db`):

1. **Input Source**: Reads unprocessed papers from `data/papers.db` (contains DOIs, titles, abstracts). This is the database created on the [Stage 1 repo](https://github.com/DianaZagirova/download_agent).

2. **Processing**: Each paper is evaluated by the LLM judge in parallel

3. **Result Storage**: Results are saved to `data/evaluations.db` using `INSERT OR REPLACE` (upsert operation)

4. **Checkpointing**: Progress is automatically saved every 50 papers (configurable)

5. **Resume Capability**: If interrupted, the script skips already-processed papers on restart

#### Database Tables

**`paper_evaluations`**: Stores individual paper classification results
- Primary key: `doi`
- Contains all fields described in the Output Fields section above

**`processing_runs`**: Tracks batch processing sessions
- Records start/end times, statistics, and worker configuration
- Useful for monitoring processing history and performance

### Configuration via Environment Variables

Customize processing behavior by editing `.env`:

```bash
# Processing Configuration
MAX_WORKERS=10                    # Default parallel workers
CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=50            # Save progress every N papers
PROGRESS_LOG_INTERVAL=10          # Log progress every N papers

# Database Paths
PAPERS_DB_PATH=data/papers.db     # Input papers database
RESULTS_DB_PATH=data/evaluations.db  # Output evaluations database
LOG_DIR=logs                      # Log file directory

# Cost Configuration (per 1K tokens)
COST_PER_1K_PROMPT_TOKENS=0.0004
COST_PER_1K_COMPLETION_TOKENS=0.0016
```

### Monitoring Progress

The script provides real-time progress updates:

```
Processing papers: 1250/108000 (1.16%) | Speed: 12.5 papers/sec | ETA: 2h 23m
Cost so far: $2.45 | Successful: 1248 | Failed: 2
```

Detailed logs are saved to `logs/processing.log` for troubleshooting and analysis.
